# Info
This is my personal Homepage configuration for my home media server.

All links (indicated by ``` https://localhost/ ``` or ``` https://example.com ```) and api keys (indicated by ``` apikeyapikeyapikey ```) will need to be replaced with your own for the cards to have stats on them, unless you don't care about that functionality and you can just remove those lines.
